# Competitive Programming
===== In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful =====

This is a repository I created to help others, who are facing difficulties while solving problems in competitive programming (aka code-based problem solving) in some popular online judges. Remember, there are countably infinite number of ways to code and solve a single problem. Also, you are not going to improve your coding skills unless you try to code yourself. This repository was created to help you explore some of the approaches of solving problems that was appearent to me. Therefore, if you come to this repository, just see the codes to get idea of one of the ways of solving a particular problem, not to copy-paste it. However, you can reuse these codes in order to reduce time consumption and maintain an efficient workflow. 

============ Happy coding. May Allaah bless you ===============
